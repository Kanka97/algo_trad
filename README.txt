#####     ALGORITHMIC TRADING USING IMAGE PROCESSING PROJECT
#####

This repository pretends to be continuation of my final bachelor's project.

Once I finished the degree, I decided to start from scratch and try to reorganize the project's fundamentals. 

On the last upload, there is basically a "main_f.py" document in where there are all the functions and generators coded for further simulations.

Then, there is a little "main_notebook.ipynb" in where there is a dummy simulation. 

For now, I've been focused on the data extraction and preprocessing part in order to build a smart strategy for the future deep learning part.
